23.12.21,1,going from any dataset selection other than ‘ocean depth’ then to any other Ocean Data => error’ vs. going ‘ocean depth’=>other ocean data works,,,
23.12.21,2,using pure satellite basemap causes logged errors,,,
23.12.21,3,no onclick for ocean data (depth etc.),,,
23.12.21,4,will not add ocean layers in when switching basemaps,,,
23.12.21,5,minimap panning is shit,,disable minimap panning?,
23.12.21,6,opacity slider value not tied to current layer’s current value when loaded in => get jumps when adjusting,,,
23.12.21,7,resolution selector not tied to current resolution,,,
23.12.21,8,admin boundaries not placed in appropriate/consistent drawing order,,,
23.12.21,9,“undefined” color in histogram labels,revert from 3.x to 2.x version,,
23.12.21,10,selection highlight hexagon does not disappear on switching hexagon resolution,,,
23.12.21,11,mapbox satellite option in basemap switcher is conjested inside its container,,,
28.12.21,12, 3D layer not readded when,,,
28.12.22,13,opacity slider doesn’t affect extruded hexagons,,,
28.12.21,14,3D mode still allows clickthrough to the 2D hexes underneath,disable onclick,check docs for mapbox has 3D/occlusion sensitive query functionality,
29.12.21,15,legend doesn’t regen when recoloring of hexes occurs,,,
29.12.21,16,dem does not regen/match the recoloring when it occurs,,,
29.12.21,17,recolor slow for denser/more data,disable for dense data/far zoom levels/small hex resolutions; add more nuances logic for regen at those levels,,
29.12.21,18,labels switcher needs to be corrected (function/tooltip/usage/icon/etc.),maybe change to reset orientation/nav,,
29.12.21,19,the mapbox streets that loads in with basemap switching is not equivalent to the initial starting config,doublecheck the explicitly removed/unwanted mapbox layers removed on init,,
,20,strange pillars extruded for 3D of ocean depth,,,
,21,"opacity slider usage to high opacity after turning on 3D shows what seems like both the old color still applying as hexes, and the 3D showing under the currently used layer",disable opacity usage on 3D;,,
,22,(attempt to reproduce and verify) 2Dmode w/ layer loaded =>,,,
